# odin-recipes
Test project
This is a test project with TOP to improve/revise my coding skills. It is a website about recipes.
I will combine everything I learned so far:
1. HTML (boilerplate, tags, elements, links, img's,..)
2. Command line (terminal)
3. Git
4. GitHub

Later on, hopefully, I will learn the CSS, and implement it into this project.
