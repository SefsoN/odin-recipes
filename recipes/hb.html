<p><h2>About the dish</h2></p>
<p>Soft and fluffy golden hamburger buns that come out of your very own oven will make you wonder why you ever bothered with those ubiquitous buns in a bag.
</p>
<p>Well, of course, buying hamburger buns isn't labor intensive so go ahead and use them for your random neighborhood barbecue, but make THESE to treat your family or friends to a totally different experience when you have more personal gatherings this summer.</p>
<p>In fact, even for the novice baker these are easy enough to make. A stand mixer with a dough hook does all the heavy lifting.</p>
<p><h2>Ingredients:</h2></p>
<ul>
   <li>3 tablespoons (42g) unsalted butter</li> 
    <li>2 tablespoons (42g) honey</li>
    <li>1 cup (224g) buttermilk</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, divided</li>
    <li>3 1/4 to 3 1/2 cups (390g to 420g) all-purpose flour, divided</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon (9.3g)  instant yeast</li>
<li>1 1/2 teaspoons (8.5g) salt</li>
<li>1 teaspoon (4g) vegetable or olive oil</li>
<li>1 tablespoon (15g) water</li>
</ul>
<p><h2>Cooking steps:</h2></p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Melt the butter and combine the wet ingredients:</strong>
    <p>In a Pyrex measuring cup, add the butter and honey. Cover it with a paper towel (butter can superheat). 
        Microwave in 10 second intervals for about 40 seconds, or until the butter melts.
        Add the buttermilk and 1 egg to the measuring cup with the melted butter. Using a fork, whisk until blended.</p></li>
    
    <li><strong>Combine the dry ingredients and yeast:</strong> 
 <p>In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add 2 1/2 cups of the flour, yeast, and salt. Turn the mixer on stir or low and mix them together.</p></li>

     <li><strong>Mix and knead the dough:</strong>
   <p> With the mixer on low speed, add the buttermilk mixture, all at once to the flour mixture in the stand mixer and mix until the liquid and dry 
       ingredients are thoroughly blended. The dough will look soft and sticky.
    Turn the mixer to medium-high and beat for 1 minute, or until the dough is soft and stretchy.
    Switch to the dough hook. On low speed, gradually mix in 3/4 cup of the flour.
    (You’ll be left with 1/4 cup of flour to use to add to the dough if it is too sticky, but you may not need it.)
    Knead the dough, for 8 minutes, or until the dough forms a ball that pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Stop the mixer occasionally to push down any 
    dough that creeps up on the dough hook. If the dough seems very sticky, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time until the dough is soft and firm to the touch it, 
    but still slightly sticky. Form the dough into a ball.</p></li>

    <li><strong>First rise:</strong>
<p>Into a large bowl, add the oil and swirl it over the bottom of the bowl. Add the dough ball and turn to coat it with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap and place 
    in a warm place to rise until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.</p></li>

    <li><strong>Shape the rolls:</strong>
    <p>On a lightly floured board, turn out the dough and press it gently to deflate it. With a knife or bench scraper, divide the dough into 8 equal pieces, 
        cutting them into wedges like a pie. Move all of the wedges to one side of the board so you have room to shape the dough.
    Hold a piece of dough in one hand and draw the edges in toward the center to form a ball. Pinch the edges to seal, turn the ball 
    over with the seam side down, and place it on part of the board with very little or no flour. You will need a little stickiness to gain traction as you 
    finish shaping the roll. Cup your fingers on one side of the roll and move it in a circular motion, drawing your cupped hand toward your thumb and using the 
    friction on the board to shape it into a ball. Wipe off excess flour with a damp cloth if the rolls are not sticking to the board. 
    Repeat with remaining rolls.</p></li>

    <li><strong>Final shaping and rise and preheat the oven:</strong> 
    <p>Line a baking sheet with parchment. Flatten the rolls so they are about 3 inches across and place them on the baking sheet 3 inches apart. 
        Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise until puffy and almost doubled in size, about 1 hour. Toward the end of the rising time, preheat the oven 
        to 375ºF.</p></li>

        <li> <strong>Brush with egg wash</strong> 
 <p>In a small bowl, beat the remaining egg and 1 tablespoon of water with a fork until thoroughly combined. Using a light touch to keep from deflating the dough,
      brush the rolls with the egg wash using a pastry brush.</p></li>

      <li><strong>Bake the bread and cool:</strong> 
    <p>Bake for 15 to 18 minutes, or until golden. You can also check for doneness with an instant read thermometer. 
    Your buns are done when the thermometer inserted into the center of the bun reaches 190°F. Remove from the oven and set on a rack to cool. 
    Slice and serve at your next cookout! </p></li>
